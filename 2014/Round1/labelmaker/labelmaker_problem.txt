Labelmaker (15 points)

David is labelling boxes in a giant warehouse. He has a *lot* of boxes to label, but unfortunately his labeling machine is broken, so only some of the letters work. In order to be efficient, David labels the boxes by first using every possible 1-letter label in alphabetical order, then using every possible 2-letter label in alphabetical order, then every 3-letter label, etc.

For example, suppose only the letters 'D', 'T', and 'Z' work. David would label the first 15 boxes as follows: D, T, Z, DD, DT, DZ, TD, TT, TZ, ZD, ZT, ZZ, DDD, DDT, DDZ. The first box is considered box #1, not box #0.

Given a set of working letters L on David's labelling machine and a number N of boxes to label, return the label on the last box.

Input
The first line of the input consists of a single integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of the string L and the integer N, separated by a space.

Output
For each test case i numbered from 1 to T, output "Case #i: ", followed by the label on the last box.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ length(L) ≤ 25
L will be in alphabetical order, consist of only uppercase letters A-Z, and contain each letter at most once
1 ≤ N ≤ 263-1
The test cases will be designed so that no label is longer than 50 letters
